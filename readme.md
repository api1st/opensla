# Open SLA

Within enterprises it is often difficult to build trust in an API within the community of would-be consumers. Trust is most often built through the experiences of early adopters and enforced by the number of open issues in GitHub or the number of stars or forks. Such community lead indicators are often not present in the enterprises controlled environment.

In order to build trust in the enterprise where there may not be a large critical user base, automated tools can be employed to perform the role of guarantor of ability of a particular API. However metrics alone are not enough to be a measure of an APIs ability, rather the metrics need to be judged against what the API is supposed to be delivering.

The Open SLA provides the bridge between the expectations of the consumer community and the achieved performance of the API.
